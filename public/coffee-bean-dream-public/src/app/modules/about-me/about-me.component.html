                    <p>
                       I hope that you enjoyed my application!  I am a beginner software engineer starting my journey of being an expert Angular programmer.
                       I am currently a Multiverse Apprentice working for Verizon.  Each day I am learning more and more and enjoying my journey.
                       I spend the majority of my free time with my partner Salma and our dog Latte!  We love getting coffee and going to AMC to watch movies together.
                       I am an avid sport fan, and I love watching and playing football and soccer.  I love all Dallas sports teams and Chelsea and Barcelona for soccer.
                       Please reach out to me if you have any questions!  The links to my Github, Email, and Linked in will be found below.  Thanks!
